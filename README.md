# SOLID

In computer programming, the term SOLID is a mnemonic acronym for five design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible and maintainable. The principles are a subset of many principles promoted by Robert C. Martin.

The code of this repository are in Java. This repository contains examples of the five SOLID design principles of object-oriented programming. Each example has a "good" and "bad" version to demonstrate adherence to and violation of the principle, respectively.

- Single Responsibility Principle
